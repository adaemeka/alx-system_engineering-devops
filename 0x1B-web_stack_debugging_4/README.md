Network issue

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

Does the server have the expected network interfaces and IPs up and running? ifconfig
Does the server listen on the sockets that it is supposed to? netstat (netstat -lpd or netstat -lpn)
Can you connect from the location you want to connect from,
to the socket you want to connect to? telnet to the IP + PORT (telnet 8.8.8.8 80)
Does the server have the correct firewall rules? iptables, ufw:
iptables -L
sudo ufw status
