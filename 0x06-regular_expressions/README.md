Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information
from text such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents.
And while there is a lot of theory behind formal languages,
the following lessons and examples will explore the more practical
uses of regular expressions so that you can use them as quickly as possible.

The first thing to recognize when using regular expressions is that
everything is essentially a character,
and we are writing patterns to match a specific sequence of characters
(also known as a string).
Most patterns use normal ASCII,
which includes letters, digits, punctuation and other symbols
on your keyboard like %#$@!,
but unicode characters can also be used to match any type of international text.
