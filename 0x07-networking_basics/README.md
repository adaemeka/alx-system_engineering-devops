The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)
is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection.
In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers:
Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

The model partitions the flow of data in a communication system
into seven abstraction layers to describe networked communication
from the physical implementation of transmitting bits across a communications medium
to the highest-level representation of data of a distributed application.
