The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model)
is a conceptual model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
that "provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for
the purpose of systems interconnection.
In the OSI reference model,
the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers:
Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

The model partitions the flow of data in a communication system into seven abstraction layers
to describe networked communication from the physical implementation of transmitting bits
across a communications medium to the highest-level representation of data of a distributed application.
Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it
and is served by the layer below it.
Classes of functionality are realized in all software development through all standardized communication protocols.
